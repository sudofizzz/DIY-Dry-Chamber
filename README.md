# DIY-Dry-Chamber
A collaborative effort to improve upon an open source code for DIY Dry Chambers

**ðŸŒ€ Hysteresis in Environmental Control:**
Hysteresis is a fundamental concept in control systems. In the context of our chamber, it prevents frequent on-off cycling of devices like humidifiers or coolers. For instance, if our target humidity is 60%, we might set our humidifier to kick in at 58% and turn off at 62%. This buffer ensures our devices aren't constantly toggling, thus prolonging their lifespan and ensuring a more stable environment.

**ðŸ”¥ PID Systems:**
PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. It's a type of control loop feedback mechanism (or controller) widely used in industrial control systems. In simple terms:

    P (Proportional): Reacts based on the present error.
    I (Integral): Reacts based on the accumulation of past errors.
    D (Derivative): Predicts future error based on its rate of change.

For our chamber, a PID system can help in maintaining a precise temperature and humidity level. It adjusts the output (like fan speed or heater power) in real-time to keep the environment as close to our target values as possible.

**ðŸ“ˆ Preemptive Triggering through Peaks & Lows:**
One advanced feature we can implement is having our system recognize patterns. If our sensors detect a rapid rise in humidity, even before it crosses our threshold, our system can preemptively activate the dehumidifier. Similarly, if a rapid drop is detected, the humidifier can be activated. This predictive approach can be crucial during critical phases of drying and curing, ensuring the environment remains stable.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any innovative ideas you might have implemented in your setups. Let's discuss how we can further refine our systems, making them smarter and more efficient!
